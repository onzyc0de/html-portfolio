    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Hi! I'm Onur Sunay Ali, 26 years old, I'm from Bulgaria.</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring web developer with a solid foundation in HTML and CSS, passionate about creating clean, responsive, and visually appealing websites. While I am just starting my journey in web development, I am highly motivated to expand my skill set and embrace new technologies to grow into a well-rounded developer. 
            I thrive on learning and problem-solving, approaching challenges with curiosity and determination. My goal is to continuously improve, adapt to emerging trends in the industry, and contribute to impactful projects. 
            I’m excited to take the first steps in my career, collaborate with others, and bring ideas to life through code. Let’s create something great together!
            In my teenage years, I was always attracted to programming and specifically the idea of ​​making something out of nothing, as in programming itself. Whether it's a WEBSITE or some kind of program, the path you'll walk while doing it is an indescribable feeling. Everything related to information technology somehow attracts me and I want to develop this in me and learn more and more new things. I am ready to devote myself fully to the IT industry.
            Outside of coding, I enjoy to go outside and chill inside of forest with walking, also love to play Basketball and Football. I like to explore new technologies and to draw anime(manga type of drawings).
            I love to play video games they help me to improve my brain, reflex and sensitivity.
            I am a detail-oriented professional with a solid foundation in office software, hardware, and IT support. Proficient in the Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook), I have experience creating organized documents, managing spreadsheets, and delivering impactful presentations.
            In addition to software expertise, I have hands-on hardware skills, including troubleshooting and maintaining systems, ensuring smooth operations in various environments. I am also adept at email communication and management, maintaining efficiency and professionalism in digital correspondence.
